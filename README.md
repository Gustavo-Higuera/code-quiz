## Description

In this project, I created a coding evaluation quiz. The questions are displayed dynamically with multiple choice answers. Upon starting the project, a timer countdown begins, and incorrect answers remove 3 seconds from the timer. After completing the quiz, the user is asked for their name to save their name along with their score to the high scores table. This data is then saved to the Local Storage of the web browser.
